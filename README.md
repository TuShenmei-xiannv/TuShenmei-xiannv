# About Me

## The Basics
- **Name**: [ShenmeiTu]  
- **Job Title**: Toolsmith (a fancy way of saying I build tools for the internet)  
- **Background**: A humanities major who somehow ended up in tech. Yes, I passed the TEM-8 (that's the English Major Band 8 exam, for the uninitiated).

## Career Adventures
- **Tool Website Creator**  
  Currently building tool websites that may or may not save the world (or at least save you a few clicks). Here are some of my creations:

- **Former Developer**  
  Once wrote code that probably worked 80% of the time. The other 20%? Let's call it "creative debugging."  

- **Ex-Tester**  
  Spent a good chunk of my life breaking things so you donâ€™t have to. Youâ€™re welcome.

## Education
- **Major**: Humanities (because why not?)  
- **English Skills**: Passed TEM-8. I can read Shakespeare, but I still canâ€™t understand why tech documentation is so confusing.

## Skills (or Things I Pretend to Know)
- **Programming Languages**: [e.g., Python, JavaScript, etc.]  
- **Tools of the Trade**: Git (commit messages like "fixed stuff" count, right?), VS Code, and a lot of caffeine.  
- **Testing Tools**: Selenium, JUnit, and my personal favorite: "Does it work? Yes? Ship it!"  
- **Other Talents**: Fluent in English, sarcasm, and overthinking.

**Disclaimer**: Iâ€™m a work in progress, just like my code. ðŸ˜„
